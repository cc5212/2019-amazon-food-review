## Less useful review
(-2,My son loves spaghetti so I didn't hesitate ordering this for him. He says they are great. I have tried them myself and they are delicious. Just open and pop them in the microwave. It is very easy. The best thing about ordering from Amazon grocery is that they deliver to your door. If you have a loved one that lives far away and may have limited transportation this is the answer. Just order what you want them to have and Amazon takes care of the rest.)
(-1,It was almost a 'love at first bite' - the perfectly roasted almond with a nice thin layer of pure flavorful cocoa on the top. You can smell the cocoa as soon as you open the canister - making you want to take a bite. You may or may not like the taste of this cocoa roasted almonds depending on your likingness for cocoa.  We are so much used to the taste of chocolate (which is actually cocoa + many other ingredients like milk ...) - that you might have never really tasted really cocoa. Tasting this item it like tasting and enjoying flavorful pure raw cocoa with crunchy almonds in the center.  Get yourself a box and see for yourself what real cocoa + almonds is ! Where this product loses a star is in its packaging - the external sleeve is kind of comes in one piece, so if you try to remove the lid, the external sleeve kind of tends to come off fully - so careful when you are removing the external sleeve for the canister.)
